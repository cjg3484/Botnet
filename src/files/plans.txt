    GET client from server
    runs client persistently? (or does client make persistence)

Client:
    register with server (POST with IP and "im new")
    POST regularly with "im alive"
        process POST response, which could be:
        1. continue, no change
        2. run screenshot
            a. GET screenshot.exe
            b. run screenshot.exe from memory
            c. send screenshot.exe back
        3. run ransomware
            a. GET ransomware.exe
            b. run ransomware.exe from memory
        (4. die)

Server:
    listen for POSTs
        1. register new clients
        2. send default response
        3. send command response
    CLI:
        list registered clients + Alive or Dead (calculated by time since last Alive)
        select client/module - queues command response based off of IP in POST

Screenshot module - DONE

Ransomware module - mostly done, tweak not to be CLI and make sure it doesnt rely on ext files
